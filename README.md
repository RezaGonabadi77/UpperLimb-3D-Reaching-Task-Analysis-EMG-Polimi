Project: Robotic-Assisted Upper Limb 3D Reaching Task: Experimental Design, Data Analysis and Synergies Identification
----------------
Functional Evaluation Laboratory 2023/2024 at Politecnico di Milano
----------------
Project Overview
----------------
This project consists of three main scripts designed to perform data analysis and visualization for the Functional Evaluation Laboratory at Politecnico di Milano. Each script serves a distinct purpose in the analysis pipeline. Additionally, there is a folder named "functions" that contains all the necessary functions for running the scripts. Users should copy and paste all the files from the "functions" folder into their working directory before executing the scripts.

Scripts Overview
----------------
1. data_analysis_beforeTable.m
2. data_analysis_afterTable.m
3. data_analysis_SYNERGIES.m

Script Details
--------------

1. data_analysis_beforeTable.m
--------------------------------
Purpose:
This script performs initial data analysis and preprocessing before constructing the main data tables. It extracts and processes relevant data from raw input files to prepare it for further analysis.

Usage:
- Ensure that all required raw data files are available in the working directory.
- Run the script in MATLAB.
- The script will generate intermediate data files that are used in the subsequent scripts.

2. data_analysis_afterTable.m
-----------------------------
Purpose:
This script takes the preprocessed data from the first script and constructs the main data tables. It includes advanced data processing and storage of the data in a structured format.

Usage:
- Ensure that the intermediate data files generated by data_analysis_beforeTable.m are present in the working directory.
- Run the script in MATLAB.
- The script will output the final data tables, which will be used in the last script for visualization and further analysis.

3. data_analysis_SYNERGIES.m
----------------------------
Purpose:
This script performs data visualization and synergy analysis using the final data tables. It generates plots and visual representations of the data to aid in the interpretation and understanding of the results.

Usage:
- Ensure that the final data tables generated by data_analysis_afterTable.m are available in the working directory.
- Run the script in MATLAB.
- The script will produce various visualizations, including plots and charts, which will be saved as image files in the working directory.

General Instructions
--------------------
1. Copy all files from the "functions" folder into your working directory. These files contain necessary helper functions required by the scripts.
2. Follow the order of execution:
   a. Run data_analysis_beforeTable.m
   b. Run data_analysis_afterTable.m
   c. Run data_analysis_SYNERGIES.m
3. Ensure that all input data files and function files are in the working directory before running the scripts.
4. Review the output files and visualizations generated by the scripts to interpret the results of the analysis.
